'A performance of movement and light, bikes and generators, as initiaded by Sten Heijster in collaboration with Adriana Štefaňáková. The site specific performance took place in Helsinki, in May of 2024. The show was Adriana dancing with Stens drawings through an urban space, guiding the audience through a story of anxious emotions and unanswered questions. <br>

As complex as this performance was - it was a true joy to have the chance to document this. Both the questions of capturing the movements through time and the light of the animations reflecting off the walls. And the ever moving crowd following the tricycle with the 15kg projecter.'
